**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


In recent discussions about working with data using SQL, we've focused on getting and handling data effectively. But it's essential to also think about being fair and making sure everyone is treated equally when we do this. There's a book called "Weapons of Math Destruction" by Cathy O'Neil about how using data without thinking carefully can cause problems, like when the computer programs we use to analyze data make unfair mistakes. This can lead to unfair or unequal results, so using data responsibly is important.

When we consider using SQL fairly, the first thing to do is check where the data comes from. It's essential to use data from lots of different types of people so that we don't accidentally treat some people unfairly. For example, if a bank uses SQL to decide who can get a loan, they need to use data from different groups of people to ensure everyone is treated fairly. It's also important to regularly check the data to ensure it's fair.

Another important thing is to be transparent about how we use the data. We should explain how we use SQL to make decisions so that everyone understands how we make choices. For example, if we use SQL to decide who to hire for a job, we should explain what we consider to make that decision so that it's fair for everyone.

We also need to use data in a way that respects people's privacy. This means that we should only use data for the purposes we promised to use it for and that people's private information is kept safe.

Lastly, it's crucial to create a culture where everyone feels included. We should teach everyone how to use data fairly and listen to different ideas to treat everyone fairly. By thinking carefully about how we use SQL, we can help ensure that we avoid accidentally making unfair choices and that everyone is treated equally.
